  <h1>My IT Journey</h1>
  <p>When I was 13 years old my dad brought home our first personal computer. That Christmas my present was the PC game half-life. Ever since that moment I could not get off the computer. I asked for a video card a few months later and that was my very first upgrade. I took a summer job pressure cleaning a warehouse and saved up enough money to build my own computer. Since then I have been building computers, repairing computers, setting up networks and maintaining networks for friends and family. I have taken many side jobs from fixing computers, soldering parts to boards, setting up security camera systems, repairing phones and lap tops, installing networks. After many years in Pharmacy and the Health Industry I have finally decided to follow my passion in Information Technology. I earned my Associates Degree in Computers and Networking Security and I am working on my Bachelors along with my<em> A+, Network+, and Linux+ certifications</em>.</p>
